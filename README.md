# ROCA-attack-on-vulnerability-CVE-2017-15361
Hello guys! 

This is my project for the thesis at Politecnico di Torino. It's a script based on python and sage.

The goal of the script is to generate an RSA key, evaluete if it's vulnerable by the ROCA attack and performe the ROCA attack.

Comments in the scripts are in italian.

### Folder structure

```

        ├── Keygen.py                                              # Keygen of the key
        ├── Fingerprinting.py                                      # Fingerprinting of the key
        └── Attack.py                                              # ROCA attack of the key
```

### Usage and libraries needed
To use this program you need to have installed on your machine python3 and sage compatible with python3.

The libraries you need to install on sage and python are: sympy, Cryptodome, math, labmath.

To start the program, open the shell of sage and use this command

```
    #sage -python3 path/to/the/folder/on/your/pc/main.py
```
